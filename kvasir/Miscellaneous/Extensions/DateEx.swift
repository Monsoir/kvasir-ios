// We are not going to extend other functions directly on Date
// Instead, functions will be extended on a property of date, called msr, which can form a kind of namespace
// Since msr is `MsrWrapper` type, so mount the functions on MsrWrapper extension
// And since Date is a struct, which is not generic, and which, is not allowed to be a constraint of `Base`
// Since protocol means generic, we declare a protocol called `_DateType`(which means this protocol is for Date only)
// Then, let struct `Date` implement `_DateType`, which make `Date` generic in a way
// Finally, `Base` will be constrainted to `Date`
